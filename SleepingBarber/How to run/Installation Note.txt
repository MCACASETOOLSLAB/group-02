Installation Notes:

    Install Dev-C++. I installed from the Version 4.9.9.2 Setup File.
    Copy graphics.h to the include/ subdirectory of the Dev-C++ directories.
    Copy libbgia. to the lib Dev-C++ directories.
    Whenever you #include <graphics.h> in a program, you must instruct the linker to link in certain libraries. 
    The command to do so from Dev-C++ is Alt-P. Choose the Parameters tab from the pop-up window and type the following into the Linker area:

    -lbgi
    -lgdi32
    -lcomdlg32
    -luuid
    -loleaut32
    -lole32
